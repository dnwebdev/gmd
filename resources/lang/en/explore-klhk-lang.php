On the top, there is a gazebo and some benches to relax and take selfies.</p>
                                <p>The bamboo bridge built in 2017 was completed within 40 days. On June 23, 2017, the bridge was inaugurated by Jembrana Regent, I Putu Artha. Jembrana Green Cliff was booming for four months in 2017. At the period, the number of tourist visiting Green Cliff reached 1,300 people per day. It did not take long time for Social Forestry Community Operators (KUPS) members who were mostly farmers got their capital back. They even get additional income from Jembrana Green Cliff.</p>
                                <p>Because selfie tourism is seasonal, the Forest Farmer Groups (KTH) plans to create tourism package to attract more tourists. The area is potential to develop because it offers beautiful cliff view, green valley, hills, forest, and trees. In addition, it is located next to other attractive tourism objects such as Rambut Siwi Shrine and Maria Cave.</p>'
